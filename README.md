> **DailySync** is a productivity dashboard designed for self-learners and developers. It combines task management, structured note-taking, and habit tracking analytics into a single, cohesive interface.

## 🚀 Why I Built This

I needed a tool that wasn't just a To-Do list. Most productivity apps separate "doing" (Tasks) from "learning" (Notes) and "reviewing" (Stats).

DailySync solves this by integrating:
1.  **Task Management** with priority levels.
2.  **Spaced Repetition Logs** for tracking learning progress.
3.  **Visual Analytics** (Heatmaps & Charts) to maintain consistency.
4.  **Cloud Sync** via Supabase so I can access it from any device.

## ⚡ Key Features

*   **Task Management**: Drag-and-drop feel, priority tagging (High/Medium/Low), and completion tracking.
*   **Focus Mode**: Built-in Pomodoro timer with a distraction-free UI.
*   **Smart Notes (Logs)**: Markdown-style editor with folder organization and tagging system.
*   **Analytics Dashboard**: 
    *   GitHub-style contribution heatmap (Last 365 days).
    *   Monthly consistency charts.
    *   Streak counter and "Unfinished Business" tracker.
*   **Authentication**: Secure Email/Password login powered by Supabase Auth.
*   **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile.
*   **Dark Mode**: toggleable theme for late-night study sessions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite.
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Mobile-first approach).
*   **Backend / DB**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime).
*   **Visualization**: Recharts.
*   **Icons**: Lucide React.

## 📦 Local Development

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dailysync.git
cd dailysync
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 4. Run the app
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema (Supabase)

If you are setting up your own Supabase instance, here is the SQL structure used:

**Table: `tasks`**
```sql
create table public.tasks (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  title text not null,
  done boolean default false,
  date text not null, -- Format: YYYY-MM-DD
  priority text default 'medium',
  is_system_generated boolean default false,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now())
);
```

**Table: `logs`**
```sql
create table public.logs (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  title text not null,
  content text,
  tags jsonb default '[]'::jsonb,
  folder text,
  created_at_ts bigint, -- Timestamp
  next_review_date text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now())
);
```

*Note: Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on both tables to ensure users can only see their own data.*

## 📈 Roadmap

- [x] Migrate from LocalStorage/Node.js to Supabase.
- [x] Implement Dark Mode.
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop for task reordering.
- [ ] Export data to PDF/Markdown.
- [ ] Google Calendar integration.
